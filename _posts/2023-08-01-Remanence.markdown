category: Quality Director and Producer
description: Remanence is a first-person souls-like where players enter a post-apocalyptic world. They must rise up, master the mechanics of combat, and defeat the ruinous robotic overlord.
description-2: Remanence is the product of 25 multi-discipline team members and ~1.5 years of development. With a team this large, communication and information clarity were high priorities for us. As the producer, I was in charge of making sure information was readily available for team members who were confused. I did this through announcements and meeting notes that were shared with the team weekly.
description-3: As Quality Director, I created a bug-tracking spreadsheet to centralize our bug reports. The spreadsheet was readily available to all team members. To properly submit a bug report, the spreadsheet mandated that every cell was filled before the report could be submitted. This provided the technical team with enough information to have a starting point for debugging.
description-4: To keep the bug-tracking spreadsheet organized and readable, I taught myself Visual Basic and created a macro that automatically accepted, validated, and constructed the reports. This meant I did not have to worry about organizing the reports by hand if a team member had not properly done so themselves, allowing bug reporting to be approachable for everyone.
description-5: A key component of our game was a difficulty. We wanted combat to be hard to master but very rewarding. We held meetings and playtests weekly in order to pin down several core ideas.<br>
    1. What did players find fun? <br>
    2. Were players interacting with the mechanics in their intended ways? <br>
    3. What was within scope? <br>
 My role was to make sure every decision made by the team was based on the feedback we received, documented, and shared in an easily accessible way. This allowed for steps to be retraced in the event of confusion on why certain decisions were made.
