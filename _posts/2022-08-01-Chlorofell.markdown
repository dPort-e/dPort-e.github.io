description: Chlorofell is a student game project developed a custom 'C++' engine. Players are placed in a post apocalyptic world where they play a sencient plant creature that must rise against the machine hivemind that has taken over the planet.
description-2: Chlorofell was built in the Flintlock engine. We worked to make the interface as robust as possible so designers and artists could work in as familiar environment as possible. Features were created to match the teammembers' requests.
description-3: One of the exciting features that I helped work on is the dynamic lighting system. I helped optimize the system so that there were fewer redundant calculations thus improving our framerate.
description-4: I also worked on the collision and physics logic for the game engine. The physics are calculated in a way so that collisions are accurate even at lower framerates or spikes in performance. This was done using dynamic programming methods to verify the player's positions.
