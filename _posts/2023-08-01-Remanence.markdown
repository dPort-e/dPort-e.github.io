category: Quality Director and Producer
description: Remanence is a first-person souls-like where players enter a post-apocalyptic world. They must rise up, master the mechanics of combat, and defeat the ruinous robotic overlord.
description-2: Remanence is the product of 25 multi-discipline team members and ~1.5 years of development. With a team this large, communication and information clarity were high priorities for us. As the producer, I was in charge of making sure information was readily available for team members who were confused. I did this through announcements and meeting notes that were shared with the team weekly.
description-3: One of the challenges we ran into during development was the complex lighting scenarios. For example, the environment above has a glowing save station mixed with a hole in the ceiling allowing natural light to enter. On top of that, the environment has pulsing globs of ferrofluid and vines arching across the environment. I ran Unreal Engines insights and got accustomed to using the viewport filters to identify areas of high lighting complexity. With these tools, we were able to keep our performance at acceptable levels while keeping our game's look.
description-4: A key component of our game was a difficulty. We wanted combat to be hard to master but very rewarding. We held meetings and playtests weekly in order to pin down several core ideas.<br>
    1. What did players find fun? <br>
    2. Were players interacting with the mechanics in their intended ways? <br>
    3. What was within scope? <br>
 My role was to make sure every decision made by the team was based on the feedback we received, documented, and shared in an easily accessible way. This allowed for steps to be retraced in the event of confusion on why certain decisions were made.
description-5: Our enemies were very important to use. We wanted players to feel drawn into this world and feel a sense of danger from their foes. Every member of the team worked together to create enemies that felt powerful and oppressive, but incredibly rewarding when beaten. The challenge was supposed to be fair, but never easy. My role as Quality Director was to test the enemies constantly to make sure they were consistent, intelligent, and, most importantly, fun to fight. I would document any bugs or inconsistencies in the enemy's movesets and regularly discuss my findings with the team.
