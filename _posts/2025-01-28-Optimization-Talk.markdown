description: I was very fortunate to be able to give a talk to DigiPen's 2025 Junior GAM350 teams. This talk was overseen by the professors of the GAM350 course, but I was granted reigns over assembling the information and presenting everything. I was given a time limit of 30 minutes and tasked with introducing the teams to Unreal Engine 5's built-in optimization tools and covering how to use them.
