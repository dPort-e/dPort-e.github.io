description: Elemental Surge is a 2D action platformer where players are tasked with ascending the tower and defeating the elemental guards of a once-mighty but fallen king.
description-2: Elemental Surge uses the same engine as Chlorofell, however, it has been slightly altered and improved to handle 2D games more efficiently. The physics were also altered to work in a side-scrolling environment.
description-3: Level layouts were designed to make players feel like they were truly exploring the castle while ascending it. Dangers lurked in the form of enemies and spike pits, but there were also treasures to be found in the form of elemental powers that helped in level traversal. Some parts of the levels were designed to have players swap between elemental forms to complete platforming puzzles.
description-4: Enemies provide challenges in making players swap between elemental forms to maximize the damage dealt. Each form has a unique way of attacking and moving, so players learn the best ways to handle their foes. Enemies also keep players thinking by changing their elemental type while in combat. This keeps combat fresh and prevents players from spamming certain elements for easy victories.
description-5: A tough and satisfying boss fight is what awaits players at the top of the evil king’s tower. This fight was designed and balanced to test players’ knowledge of the game mechanics. From changing the boss’s attack patterns to changing how the boss moves, many alterations have been made to this final fight.
